Hi Jam,

As far as i remember, we are requesting for 4 laptops and 2 mobile wifi internet devices to help in development of the software.  These will be returned to you as soon as the project is completed.
  We would also like for you to create NDAs for all the people that will join the project.  Maybe create one form and then a signature sheet so if multiple people join the project we won't have to have too many forms.
  
This is for everyones protection.

I was hoping by next week to have requirements analysis start; I will probably want to introduce you to Elmer and/or Zul and they will do initial data gathering; hopefully you could bring all the forms the school uses.
On Jan 20-25 I'll be going on official travel with Philhealth so the sooner we can start, the better.  At least we can get the ball rolling as things are pretty busy for everyone at the moment and we need to try to get 
as much work done as possible with the limited time that we have.


Best Regards,

Rommel
